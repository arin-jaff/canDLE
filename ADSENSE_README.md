Sign up at adsense.google.com with your Google account
Add your site — enter your Cloudflare Pages domain (e.g. candle.pages.dev or custom domain)
Paste the AdSense snippet into index.html <head> — Google gives you a <script> tag with your publisher ID (ca-pub-XXXXXXX)
Wait for approval — Google reviews your site (typically 1-3 days, sometimes up to 2 weeks). They check for: original content, sufficient pages, privacy policy, no policy violations
Create ad units — after approval, create "Display ads" in your AdSense dashboard. Each unit gives you a data-ad-slot ID
